# Foodhub with Bootstrap

In this project, we'll practice using Bootstrap.

## [Here is your target.](https://foodhub-with-bootstrap-target.herokuapp.com/landing.html)

## Setup

1. Click the "Clone or download" button.
1. Select "Download ZIP".
1. Extract and open the entire folder in Atom.
1. Open `landing.html` in Chrome.

## Suggested Steps

 1. I've already downloaded and included Bootstrap in the project for you.
 2. I have also included an `additional_styles.css`, which contains my standard vertical spacing classes.
 1. I've already included all of the content without any formatting in `landing.html`.
 1. Use [Shoelace.io](http://shoelace.io/) to create a skeleton grid for your layout, and then copy-paste it into your page.
 2. Move the content into the appropriate cell in your skeleton.
 3. Utilize Bootstrap classes to make the page look like the target. Here are some things that might come in handy:
   - [Buttons](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#buttons-options)
   - [Responsive images and shapes](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#images-responsive)
   - [Forms](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#forms)
   - [Media objects](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#media)
   - [Unstyled lists](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#unstyled)

You will have to write some of your own custom CSS for this project in `additional_styles.css`. A hint for the full-width images:

```
.who-delivers {
  background: url("images/main-hero.jpg") no-repeat center center;
  background-size: cover;
  color: white;
  height: 500px;
  padding-top: 150px;
}
```
